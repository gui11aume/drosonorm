This is the drosonorm package for Drosophila array normalization. In its present state, it relies heavily on the specifications of a custom NimbleGen microarray used in the van Steensel lab. Those specifications are .rda files not included in the remote repository for reasons of disk space.

At present, the only way to get these files is to ask them to me.
